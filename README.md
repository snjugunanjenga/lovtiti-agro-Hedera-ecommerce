# 🌾 Lovtiti Agro Mart

**Decentralized Marketplace for African Farmers — Powered by Hedera & Blockchain**

---

## 🚀 Project Vision

Lovtiti Agro Mart was born from the heartbreak of harvests lost and hopes crushed. In many African communities, farmers work tirelessly yet face unfair pricing, middlemen exploitation, and limited market access. Consumers, meanwhile, pay high prices for low-quality produce.

We envision a transparent, decentralized marketplace where farmers can sell directly to buyers—backed by blockchain, smart contracts, and stablecoin payments. With Lovtiti, we bring **fairness, traceability, and empowerment** to agriculture.

## 🌍 Why This Matters

- 🧑‍🌾 **Empowers Farmers**: Transparent pricing and direct access to buyers.
- 🛒 **Benefits Consumers**: Affordable, traceable, and fresh produce.
- 🔗 **Blockchain-Backed**: Smart contracts ensure secure, tamper-proof transactions.
- 💸 **No Middlemen**: Payments handled via Hedera escrow and Stripe integration.
