## ❗ Challenge We’re Solving

Across Africa, countless farmers face devastating losses after harvest. Their produce spoils, their livestock is undervalued, and their hard work is often exploited by middlemen. Limited access to fair markets and transparent pricing keeps them trapped in cycles of poverty.

**Lovtiti Agro Mart** is our solution: a decentralized marketplace that connects farmers directly to buyers using Hedera blockchain technology. No middlemen. No guesswork. Just trust, transparency, and fair trade.

---

## 💔 Why It Matters

In rural communities, the story is heartbreakingly familiar:

- Crops rot because buyers never arrive.
- Livestock is sold at unfair prices just to make ends meet.
- Fishermen return with full nets but no market.
- Beekeepers watch their honey spoil without access to buyers.

These aren’t isolated incidents—they’re daily realities. **Lovtiti Agro Mart** was born from this pain. It’s more than a platform; it’s a movement to restore dignity, income, and control to the people who feed our continent.
