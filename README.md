❗ Problem Statement
African farmers face post-harvest losses, limited market access, and unfair pricing due to middlemen. Lovtiti Agro Mart solves this by offering a decentralized platform that connects farmers directly to buyers using Hedera blockchain.

💔 Why This Matters

In many rural communities, farmers work tirelessly for months — planting, watering, and hoping. But when harvest time comes, they often face heartbreaking losses. Crops rot in the field because buyers never show up. Livestock is sold at unfair prices just to survive. Fishermen return with full nets but no market. Beekeepers watch their honey spoil without access to buyers.

These stories aren’t rare — they’re daily realities. Lovitti Agro Mart was born from this pain. It’s a platform built to restore hope, dignity, and income to the people who feed our continent.

🌍 Project Vision
** Lovitti Agro Mart was born from the heartbreak of harvests lost and hopes crushed. Across Africa, farmers, fisherfolk, beekeepers, and livestock keepers pour their lives into the land and sea — only to be met with unfair prices, spoiled goods, and no access to buyers. Lovitti is our answer.

It’s a decentralized marketplace where every producer — from cassava growers to catfish farmers — can connect directly with buyers, backed by blockchain and powered by Hedera. With HARAR guiding every transaction, we bring history, availability, reviews, authentication, and real-time updates into the hands of those who need it most.

Lovitti isn’t just a platform. It’s a movement to restore dignity, income, and control to the people who feed our continent.

## 🔐 How HARAR & HBAR Work Together in a Transaction
Imagine a buyer named Amina wants to purchase tomatoes from a farmer named Kofi. Here’s how Lovitti Agro Mart uses HARAR and HBAR to make that transaction seamless and trustworthy:


🅷 History of Product (HARAR)
- Amina views the entire lifecycle of the tomatoes: harvest date, handling process, and previous transactions.
- This history is stored immutably on the Hedera Hashgraph using HBAR to anchor the data.

🅰 Availability of Product (HARAR)
- Real-time inventory shows how many crates are available.
- Updates are written to the blockchain using HBAR microtransactions, ensuring accuracy and transparency.

🆁 Reviews and Ratings (HARAR)
- Amina checks feedback from other buyers.
- Each review is timestamped and stored on-chain, secured by HBAR to prevent tampering.

🅰 Authentication of Product (HARAR)
- Kofi’s tomatoes carry a digital certificate verified by Lovitti’s smart contract.
- The certificate is validated using HBAR-powered smart contract calls, confirming origin and legitimacy.

🆁 Real-Time Updates (HARAR)
- Amina receives live updates: payment confirmation, dispatch time, and delivery tracking.
- Each update is logged on the Hedera network using HBAR, creating a transparent audit trail.

💸 Role of HBAR in Lovitti Agro Mart

- Transaction Fees: Every blockchain interaction—whether storing data or executing smart contracts—is paid for using HBAR.
- Smart Contract Execution: HARAR logic is embedded in smart contracts that run on Hedera, powered by HBAR.
- Security & Speed: HBAR ensures fast, low-cost, and secure transactions—ideal for agricultural micro-payments.

🌍 Why This Matters
