"Initialize a TypeScript Next.js project for Lovitti Agro Mart - a comprehensive blockchain-powered agricultural ecosystem connecting farmers, distributors, transporters, buyers, and agro veterinarians. Create structure: `/app` (Next.js), `/prisma` (Neon PostgreSQL), `/smart-contracts` (Hedera), `/backend` (USSD), `/.cursorrules`, `/prompts.md`. Include subfolders for auth, onboarding, dashboard, listings, admin, components, and API routes. Generate `package.json` with dependencies: `@clerk/nextjs`, `@hashgraph/sdk`, `@prisma/client`, `@stripe/stripe-js`, `stripe`, `tailwindcss`, `shadcn/ui`, `@radix-ui/react-components`, `ipfs-http-client`, `redis`, `elasticsearch`. Configure `tailwind.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`, `prisma/schema.prisma` for Neon, and `.env` for Clerk, Stripe, Neon, Hedera, Redis, and Elasticsearch keys. Create `README.md` and a GitHub Actions workflow in `/.github/workflows/ci.yml` for CI/CD."

## 4. Hedera Wallet Integration & Supply Chain Tracking
**Prompt**:  
"Create a TypeScript module in `/utils/hedera.ts` for Hedera Hashgraph wallet integration supporting multi-stakeholder transactions. Include functions for connecting wallets, signing transactions, supply chain tracking, and caching encrypted private keys in localStorage for offline access. Use `@hashgraph/sdk` for testnet interactions. Generate comprehensive Solidity contracts in `/smart-contracts/contracts/` including Marketplace.sol for HBAR escrow payments, SupplyChain.sol for product traceability, and Logistics.sol for transportation tracking. Include deployment scripts in `/smart-contracts/scripts` and Mocha/Chai tests in `/smart-contracts/tests`. Ensure secure key management and TypeScript interfaces for all user types."

## 5. Multi-Role Listing & Service Management System
**Prompt**:  
"Build a comprehensive listing system supporting all user types: farmers (products), distributors (bulk goods), transporters (logistics services), and agro veterinarians (agricultural products and services). Create `/app/listings/create/page.tsx` and `/app/listings/browse/page.tsx` with role-based forms. Allow farmers to list products (name, quantity, price, images, video), distributors to list bulk goods and services, transporters to list logistics offerings (capacity, routes, pricing), and agro veterinarians to list agricultural products (seeds, vaccines, pesticides, equipment) and expert services (consultations, equipment leasing, advice). Include validation, supply chain tracking, and quality certifications. Store data in Neon using Prisma and images in IPFS. Publish listings via Hedera smart contracts. Use TailwindCSS, Shadcn, and Radix UI. Generate API routes in `/app/api/listings` and Jest tests in `/tests/listings`."

## 6. Multi-Role Dashboard System
**Prompt**:  
"Create specialized dashboards for all user types: `/app/dashboard/farmer/page.tsx`, `/app/dashboard/distributor/page.tsx`, `/app/dashboard/transporter/page.tsx`, `/app/dashboard/buyer/page.tsx`, and `/app/dashboard/agro-vet/page.tsx`. Include role-specific features: farmers (product management, order tracking), distributors (inventory management, supplier connections), transporters (route optimization, cargo tracking), buyers (product discovery, supply chain visibility), agro veterinarians (product sales management, equipment leasing, expert advice, client consultations). Include filtering, real-time updates, and analytics. Cache data in localStorage for offline access. Style with TailwindCSS, Shadcn, and Radix UI. Integrate with Clerk for auth and Prisma for data management. Generate API routes in `/app/api/dashboard` and Jest/Cypress tests in `/tests/dashboard`."

## 7. Supply Chain Smart Contracts & Logistics Management
**Prompt**:  
"Write comprehensive Solidity smart contracts in `/smart-contracts/contracts/` including Marketplace.sol for multi-stakeholder transactions, SupplyChain.sol for product traceability, Logistics.sol for transportation management, and Veterinary.sol for health record tracking. Use Hedera Contract Service for testnet deployment. Generate TypeScript functions in `/utils/hedera.ts` for contract interactions (e.g., `createListing`, `placeOrder`, `trackSupplyChain`, `scheduleTransport`, `recordHealthData`). Include deployment scripts in `/smart-contracts/scripts` and Mocha/Chai tests in `/smart-contracts/tests`. Ensure secure transaction handling and multi-role access control."

## 8. STREAM API Integration & Real-Time Communication
