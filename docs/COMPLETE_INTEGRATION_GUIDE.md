```bash
# Start the application
npm run dev

# Initialize contract monitoring
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/system/initialize
```

## 🔄 Event Flow

### Farmer Registration
1. User completes KYC onboarding
2. Wallet connection established
3. `createFarmer()` called on contract
4. `farmerJoined` event emitted
5. Event handler creates farmer in database
6. User marked as contract farmer

### Product Creation
1. Farmer creates product listing
2. Product added to database
3. `addProduct()` called on contract
4. `productCreated` event emitted
5. Event handler updates listing with contract data
6. Product available for purchase

### Product Purchase
1. Buyer selects products in cart
2. Checkout process initiated
3. `buyproduct()` called for each item
4. `productBought` event emitted

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Contract Not Deployed**
   - Verify contract address in environment variables
   - Check network configuration

2. **Event Monitoring Not Working**
   - Verify RPC URL is correct
   - Check WebSocket connection status
   - Review event processing logs

3. **Wallet Connection Issues**
   - Ensure MetaMask is installed
   - Check network configuration
   - Verify account permissions

4. **Database Sync Issues**
   - Check Prisma client generation
   - Verify database connection
   - Review event handler logs

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check service status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/system/status

# Get contract statistics
curl http://localhost:3000/api/contract/stats

# Process unprocessed events
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/contract/process-events

# Get delivery statistics
curl http://localhost:3000/api/delivery/stats
```
