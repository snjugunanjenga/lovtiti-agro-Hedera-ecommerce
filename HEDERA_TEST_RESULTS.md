### API Endpoints Created
1. `/api/test/hedera-basic` - Basic connection test
2. `/api/test/hedera-report` - Comprehensive test report
3. `/api/test/hedera-final` - Final integration test
4. `/api/transactions/transfer` - HBAR transfer functionality
5. `/test-hedera` - Interactive test page

## 🚀 Capabilities Verified

- ✅ Connect to Hedera testnet
- ✅ Authenticate with account credentials
